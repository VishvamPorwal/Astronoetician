# Astronoetician: Leveraging Neural Nets to Sculpt Celestial Semantics
![Astronoetician](images/logo.png)
Astronoetician is a character-level language model that generates creative and novel names for celestial bodies. This project is inspired by the paper "A Neural Probabilistic Language Model" and aims to combine the realms of astronomy and language generation through neural networks.

## Overview

The Astronoetician project aims to combine the power of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) with the creative exploration of language to generate imaginative names for planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial entities. By training the model on existing celestial names, Astronoetician produces novel and evocative names that capture the essence of the universe.

## Features

- Utilizes a character-level language modeling architecture inspired by neural probabilistic language models.
- Generates unique and captivating names for celestial bodies, expanding the boundaries of language creativity.
- Allows customization of model parameters and hyperparameters to fine-tune name generation.
- Supports both training of the model on new datasets and generating names based on existing trained models.


## Architecture(as described in the paper):

## Dataset
The database contains the names of all the minor planets. The dataset is available in the `data` folder.

## Results
The model was trained for 10000 epochs and the following results were obtained:
```
